Prebuilt Alternative Firmware for Sensor Watch
==============================================

This section contains the stock firmware for Sensor Watch, as well as several prebuilt firmware images featuring an alternative set of watch faces.

### Prebuilt Firmwares

Note that each fimware comes in two flavors, depending on the color of your circuit board. This is because blue boards have a red/blue LED and green boards have a red/green LED, and the pins are swapped. No damage will result from loading the wrong firmware onto your board, but the LED colors will be wrong. 

Also note that all of these have the "Preferences" and "Time Set" screens at the end; for brevity they aren't included in this listing, but you will always have access to them.
